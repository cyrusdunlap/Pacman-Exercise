# Pacman

## Description
This app will allow you to create as many pacmen as you want by clicking the add pacman button. Then you will be able
to push the start game button and they will move around the screen boucning off the corners.

## How to run
1. Download the file to your computer
2. Load the index.html file into a blank browser.
3. At the top left will have an add pacman button, press as many as you would like.
4. Once you have added as many as you want press the start game button.
5. This will put them in motion biting and bouncing off the edge of the screen and coming back.

## Future improvements
I would like to add random colors to the pacman and maybe some of the bad guys.
